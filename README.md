# Defense-GRID - Linux-Based Firewall

Defense-GRID is a Linux-based firewall built from the ground up to take full advantage of the tuning capabilities presented in Linux to make a Next-Generation
firewall. 

Defense-GRID can act in client, server, or standalone modes.

# Requirements

- Ruby
- Linux


# Features

Remote Management - Defense-GRID gives users the ability to run a centralized manager that can talk back to and manage one or many firewalls
all at once. Armed with a web-based GUI that will allow you to manage your firewall deployments with ease.

Code Auditability - From the first line of code to the latest, each revision and pull request is requested to be signed with a GPG key and all code is publically
available up in Github. No binary blobs or proprietary components involved.

Distro Agnostic - Install on your preferred Linux distro and Defense-GRID will adapt to work in your environment. Some distros may not recieve the full platform support
but you will see a warning about that before installing.
