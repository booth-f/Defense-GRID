## Reporting a Vulnerability

Find an issue in a supported release? 

All vulnerability disclosures will follow suite with Google's Project Zero, following a strict 90-day disclosure deadline with public bugtracking where the vulnerability disclosure 
process will be documented.

You should expect a response to your report within a day if not less. Barring situations that make it difficult to recreate the reported vulnerability you will usually recieve a 
response back immediately following a vulnerability confirmation check along with the current status on a fix.

In the event a vulnerability does not get patched within the 90-day window there will be a PSA that will take the form of a workaround or result in the temporary disabling of the affected feature until a proper fix can be made.
